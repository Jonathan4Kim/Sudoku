### Sudoku Solver and Generator Projects

## Project 1: Sudoku Solver using Pygame

### Overview
This project involves developing a Sudoku Solver using the Pygame library. The application allows users to input their Sudoku puzzles and solve them using a backtracking algorithm. The Pygame GUI provides a visual representation of the Sudoku grid and highlights the solving process step-by-step.

### Features
- **User Input**: Allows users to enter their own Sudoku puzzles.
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Implements a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzles.
- **Visual Feedback**: Highlights the solving process in real-time for better understanding.
- **Reset and Clear Functions**: Users can reset the puzzle or clear the board to input a new puzzle.

### What I Learned
- **Familiarity with GUIs**: Explored the Pygame library to create a graphical user interface.
- **Sudoku Game**: Gained a deeper understanding of Sudoku rules and logic.
- **AI Algorithms**: Learned and implemented the backtracking algorithm to solve puzzles.
- **OOP**: Applied object-oriented programming principles to structure the project efficiently.

### Differences Between Pygame and Tkinter
- **Pygame**: Best suited for game development and applications requiring real-time graphics and animations. It provides a wide range of functionalities for handling multimedia, events, and game logic.
- **Tkinter**: Ideal for standard GUI applications with more straightforward interface requirements. It is part of the Python Standard Library, making it easily accessible for creating windows, dialogs, and other common GUI elements.

## Project 2: Sudoku Generator using Tkinter

### Overview
This project involves developing a Sudoku Generator using the Tkinter library. The application generates Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels and allows users to solve them within the same interface. The Tkinter GUI offers a clean and straightforward user experience for puzzle generation and interaction.

### Features
- **Puzzle Generation**: Creates Sudoku puzzles of different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to solve the generated puzzles within the application.
- **Validation**: Checks the user's solutions for correctness.
- **Hints and Solutions**: Provides hints and complete solutions to help users.
